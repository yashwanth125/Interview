## Pseudocode
# Code below is written in python by Yashwanth for Qualcomm interview.
#
#Steps:
# 1. Initialise the 
## a. Belt of length 3, for belt we are using Deque Data structure in python.
## b. workers count, here we took it as three
# 2. Iterate for 100 steps and in each step, remove the last element from end 
#    and append the new component randomly generated to the left side of the deque
# 3. During each iteration, perform the assining of components based on below scenarios
## a. If adjacent worker performed a task then block the worker
## b. If the product is completed and waiting then decerement the count by 1
## c. If components is not assigned to worker and its present in the belt adjacent to them then assign it to him
## d. If the belt component is empty then push the product if its ready at workers hand.
